### Terminology
`Domain` - area of network orginzs by single auth db
`Domain Controller` - server that do authentication and authorization
`Domain Computer` - registered device to the auth db ==> AD Object
`AD Object` - an elemnt of AD like: User or Group or Printer or Computer 
`Group Policy Object` - virtual collection of policies for AD objects
`Organization Unit` - subidivion/subfolder of and AD - place inside objectets or other OU
`Directory Service` - provides method of storing directory data and making it availale

### Managing multi-tenant user
- tenant is represented by unique `domain` - like test.com 
- if domain is not specified we use: test.microsoft.com
- every account is part of at least 1 tenant
- tenant must have subscription associated in order to be able create resources
- tenant can have 2+ subscriptions too

- `Subscriptions` - independent to tenant or user 
- Paymenet agreement
- 3 types:
 1. Free
 2. Pay as you go
 3. Enterprise

### Azure AD connect/join
- Connect on prem to AD in Cloud (Azure AD)
- We can use cloud-only to authenticate to Windows Machines on Prem
- When you don't have on prem AD
- When you dont want to put some users to on prem AD
- Add support for SSO
- Features:
  - Password hash sync - sync hash for passwords with on prem
  - Pass-through - allow to use same user/pass on prem and on cloud too
  - Federation - hybrid environment using on prem AD FS infra
  - Synchronization - auto sync between om prem and cloud for users/groups/...
  - Health Monitoring - provides central monitoring in azure portal

### Administrative Units
- Used in large org. and divide them to multiple groups (administrative units)
- Easier management
- Assing roles to Administrative units
- Premium feature

### Manage Users and Groups
- username can be email only from associated domain
- its possible to invite too by emails
- Dynamic Groups - add users automatically to groups based on conditions
- Guest Users = users which are part of another organization - possible to invite

- Password reset can be enabled per group - after users can do it themself 
- Password reset can use email, phone num, Microsoft App Code, Office Phone, security questions 
  - Auth info is valid for 180 days by default
- Password reset can be enabled for selected users or all or none (no group option)
- Assign roles or applications directly to group
- Groups can have:
 - Owners - have permissions + manage members
 - Member - have permissions

- Assign access rights to users
  - direct assignements - assign manually to users
  - group assignements - assign permissions via group to users
  - rule based - create rule which dynamically assign users to groups
  - external authority - access come via external source like on prem or Saas

- Deleted remains for 30 days as deleted - can be reverted for accidental delete

### Bulk Operations:
- We can create, invite, delete & download users
- It can be through one bulk csv file which is uploaded

### Device Management
- Manage physical devices - like phones, pc, printers
- See what is connected
- Device can be added - external registration
- After permission can be specified
- We can limit only users from registered devices
- In Windows - there is App: Connect -> this can register to Azure -> enter user/pass and it will be done
- We can utilize BYOD and see if device are secure enough
- 3 ways:
 1. Azure AD registered 
  = personal devices 
  = signed with Microsoft account or local account 
  = targeting personal accounts 
  = no org linked, BYOD or mobile dev
  = Android, Mac, IIOS, Win 10
  = Sign in: end user, password, win hello, PIN, biometrics or pattern on phone
  = Device Management by intune or App Management
  = SSO
 2. Azure AD joined 
  = owned by org and signed with Azure AD belonging to org
  = exists only in cloud
  = suitable for cloud only and hybrid (private cloud) org
  = Device sign in: Password, Win Hello for Business, FIDO2.0
  = Device management by intune or Microsoft Endpoint Configuration ManagerÃŸ
  = Supports SSO to both cloud and on prem Dev
  = Conditional Access through MDM enrollment and compliance evaluation 
  = Entrerpise state roaming
  = Azure AD Domain services belonging to that org, they exists in cloud or on prem
 3, Hybrid Azure AD joined devices
  = Suitable for org, with local AD and wanna mix them with Azure
  = Devices owned by organization
  = Password loging or Windows Hello for business
  = Use windows autopilot = automated device provisioning for new windows devices
  = Windows autopilot = if provisioned, devices can be maanged by: Intune, Windows Update for Business, Microsoft endpoint config manager

### Windows Hello
- Windows 10 service to login via alternate way like, fingerprint, iris scan or facial recognition

### Azure MDM and MAM
- Mobile Device Management (MDM) - control the entire device, wipe data and so
- Mobile Application Management (MAM) - publish, push and configure, secure, monitor and update mobile apps 
- Both are part of: Microsoft Intune => part of Premium 2
- Intune is part of Microsoft Endpoint Manager == part of ===> Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS)
- EMS - is inteligent mobility management and security platform. Protect and Seure your org and empowers flexibility
- EMS - multiple services are part of it like: Azure AD or Intune and more

### Regions
- Classic, closer to customer, data is located in same place, some services are avialable only on some, some of them are global services 
- Regional pairs are siblings for specific regions to create better HA

### Microsoft Authenticator App
- like Duo - used for 2 factor auth + passwordless or password autofill

### Roles
- 3 types of roles exists (origin): (next sections)
 = Classic Admin - original role (used rarely)
 = Azure roles - RBAC on top of resource management
 = Azure AD roles - used to manage Azure AD resources in a directory
- Global Admin and User Access admin - are in both groups and can control both sections

### Classic Administrators
- Defined at subscription level, used in early days
- just a susbcription scope - management groups does not exists here
- don't support custom roles
- 3 types of roles:
 = Account Admin - billing owner, no access to azure portal
 = Service Admin - same access of user asssigned the owner role at subscriptions scope. Full portal access
 = Co-Admin - same access as user who assigned the owner - cannot delegate access

### RBAC
- Used for Authorization
 - 2 types: builtin and custom
- Highest Role: Global Administrator
- We can greant access to recources or resource groups
- Roles can be assigned to users, user groups, service principle
- Role assignements consists of:
 = security principal - user, group or security principal (identity of applications or services)
 = role definition - collection of permissios - specify if operation can read, write or delete
 = scope - set of resources (mgmt group, subscription, resource groups or resources) - which it applies to
- Deny Assignement - deny some specific actions even if roles allow it
- Custom roles can be created we need Premium Level plan
- Custom can specify like: Read and Update (don't delete) - add permsissions/actions
- We can include or exclude permissions (all except selected)

### Azure AD Roles
- used to manage Azure AD resources in dir like
  = create or edit users
  = reset user passwords
  = manage domains
  = manage licences

- Built in roles:
 = Global Admin - Full access to everything
 = User admin - full access to create and manage users
 = Billing admin - make purchase, manage subscriptions and support tickets

- Custom roles can be created by having Azure AD Premium P1 or P2

### Azure Policy
- Limit users to not create expensive resources
- Define policies to enforce company standards and SLAs
- It can also limit Resource Types, versions, locations, default tagging, VM SKUs (Flavor)
- In GUI, its 'Policy"
- Scope - for full subscription or Resource Groups under Subscription
- Policies can be applied on Resource Groups level to for example ensure policicies like have tag or encrypted disk
- Policy can be associated with powershell too, example:
1. Save Policy Def
 ```$policy = Get-AzPolicyDefinition | Where-Object { $_.Properties.DisplayName -eq "Policy name" }```

2. Create RG
 ``` New-AzResourceGroup -Name "test-rg" -Location "East EU" ```

3. Save it to variable
```$rg = Get-AzResourceGroup -Name "test-rg" -Location "East EU" ```

4. Assign Policy
``` New-AzPolicyAssignement -Name "Rulez" -DisplayName "Rulez" -Scope $rg.ResourceId -PolicyDefinition $policy ```

### Azure Policies vs Azure Roles (RBAC)
- Policies - ensure compliance of resources - evaluates - does not restrict just review and alarm
- Roles - control access and limit what we can do - restrict access and permissions

### Azure AD Resource vs Azure Roles (RBAC)
- AD Roles - control access to AD resouces (like users, groups, billing, licensing...)
- RBAC - control access to Azure resources (virtual machines, databases, storage, networking, ...)
- By default global admin does not have acces to Azure resources

### Azure Resource Manager
- Not a single services but multiple services
- Allow to create, update and delete resources
- Its a middleware between requester (CLI, API, SDK) and actual resources <--> Communicates with Authentication service
- Scope is a logical grouping of resources
- Sopes: Management Groups -> Subscriptions -> Resource Groups and Actual Resources

### Management Groups
- Contains another layer of managerment groups or subsciptions
- Used to group subscriptions
- Apply policies there

### Subscriptions
- Identity = name used for auth
- Account = user or app - used for authentication, Identity + More info
- Tenant = orgnaization - represented by domain name
- Subscription is billing agreement (Free, pay as you go, azure for students)
- Resource is any entity managed by account - VM, WebApp, Storage Account, anything created
- Resource groups - Organize resources to group 
- All resources can belong to 1 resource group only

- We can add users to subscription, shared payment
- Susbscription can have access control - various roles can be chosed - cores are Owner/Contributor/Reader
- Contributor cannot assign other users to subscriptions (owner can)

### Cost Management and Billing
- It can do cost analysis and predict what we will pay
- See invoices and billings

### Resource [Group] Locks
- Lock overwrites RBAC roles and does not allow to do even if we have rigts
- Used in critical resources to avoid accidental deletion or modification
- Users with permissions can delete locks
- Lock types:
 - Read-Only - don't delete/create/update any resource also move is restricted
 - Delete - just don't delete resource
- Lower layers (subscription, resource groups, ...) - inherites the lock
- Locks does not affect permission in data layer

### Resources Providers
- Allow to use specific resources
- Register to them (enable them) like Kubernetes and after you can use it
- Enable under subscriptions

### Relationship between User Subscritpion Tenant
- User - lowest level
- Tenant - exist by defualt (contains users)
- To create resource we need subscription
- We can have multiple subscriptions 
- Subscriptions are associated with users
- Management group contains subscriptions or other MGMT groups
- We can add users to Management Groups and then they will have proper subscriptions

### Azure Blueprints
- Quick creation of governed subscriptions
- Declarative wat to orchestrate  delpoyments of various resource templates and other artifacts: Role Assignement, Policy Assignemetn, ARM templates, RG
- Differnece between ARM Templates is that ARM is local file and no direct connection of template to azure
- BLueprints creates definitions in cloud what should be deployued and assignemnent, what was deployed, can upgrade several subsciptions
- Blueprints supports imrpoved tracking and auditing deployments (follow up after deploy)

### ARM Templates
- IaC
- Azure resources defined in JSON files
- Declarative - exactly defined resources what to deploy
- create, edit or delete big deployments in minutes
- reduce configuration mistakes
- Modular and Extensible (with powershell or bash scripts)
- Testable
- Preview - see changes before apply
- Tracked deployment
- Used in CI/CD
- Exportable code
- If you deploy and fails, not automatic clean for resources created already
- no rollback -deleting template is not deleting htem
- Delete unwanted resource manually via deployments screen

- Example:
```
{
  "$schema":<schema url>, # tell what schema to use and what fields to expect
  "contentVrsion": "1.0", # Custom definition of template version, any string
  "apiProfile": "",  # used to avoid specify api version for each resource in template
  "parameters": {},  # custom values to pass with your templates, supports default value
  "variables": {},  # transform variables and resource properties using function expressions
  "functions": [],  # user defined functions
  "resources": [],  # azure resources used are specified here like VM, Storage, ...
  "outputs":{}      # values returned after deployment
}
```

## Manage Azure Storage Accounts
- Like S3 in AWS
- Types of storages:
  = General Purpose v1 (legacy)
  = General Purpose v2 
  = Blob Storage (legacy) - object storage
  = Block Blob Storage
  = File Storage - file system based
- Containers are like dirs/folders where we can upload files

- 5 core storage services:
 = Azure Blob - object store
 = Azure Files - file strorage, like NFS/SAMBA
 = Azure Tables - NoSQL Store - schemaless structured data
 = Azure Queues - Messaging storage
 = Azure Disks - Bock level storage for Azure VMs

### Replication and Data Redundancy
- Defined per storage account
- Storing multiple copies of data for data availability
- higher redundancy means higher cost of replication
- Primary Region Redundancy:
 1. Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) - synchronous copy of data, 11x 9, cheapest
 2. Zone-Redundant storga (ZRS) - data copied synchronous accross 3x AZ in 1x regio, 12x 9 durability
 = Data replicated 3 times in same region
- Secondary Region Redundancy
 1. Geo Redundant Storage (GRS) - synchronous copy inside primary and asynchronous on secondary. 16x 9s durability
 2. Geo-Zone Redundant Storage (GZRS) - synchronous copy inside primary 3x AZ and asynchronous on secondary. 16x 9s durability
 = Data center loss and disaster recovery usage
 = Secondary regions is based on region pair and its not avaialble for read or write
- Secondary Region - Only Read Access
 1. Read Access Geo Redundant Storage (RA-GRS) - synchronous copy in regions and between, 16x 9 durability
 2. Read Access Geo Zone Redundant Storage (RA-GZRS)- synchronous in regions between 3x AZ and between regions, 16x 9 durability
 = Only option to use synchronous replication
 = Allow to have read access from secondary region

### Providing access
- Access keys - 2x can be generated - can be changed if needed, permanent access, mostly for scripts
- Shred Access Signature (SAS) - additional access key with limited timeline, can be defined how long its valid

### Azure Blob
- Object store to store massive amounts of data unstructured
- Composed:
 = Storage Account - unique namespace for data (like bucket in S3)
 = Containers - similar to folders
 = Blobs - data chuncked and stored

- Blob Storage types:
 = Block blobs - store text and binary data, data can be changed individualy,  store up to 4.75TiB
 = Append Blobs - optimized for append operations, ideal for logging
 = Page Blobs - store random access files - up to 8TiB 

- Data can be moved to storage by:
 = Power Shell - AzCopy
 = Azure Storage Data Movement Libbrate - SDK, .net library
 = Azure Data Factory - ETL service
 = BLobfuse - Virtual filesystem driver, access data through linux FS
 = Azure Data Box - dedicated device to transport data (Snow family in AWS)
 = Azure Import/Export service - service to ship physical disks to Azure

### Performance Tiers for Blobs
- Mostly 2 kind exists:
  = Standard - use HDD, various performance (based on hot, cool and archive), used for backup and media content
  = Premium - leverage SSD for High thorughput and low latency, used for analytics,AI & ML, data transformation
- Define mostly IOPS

### Access Tiers for Blobs
- Applies to blobs
- 3 types
 = Cool - data accessed less then 30 days, lower cost, higher access cost, short backups and disaster recovery, old media content
 = Hot - data accessed frequently, highest cost, regular used data
 = Archive - data accessed and stored for 180 days, lowest cost for data but highest access cost, long term backup, archive datasets, origin raw data, compliance data

- by default using Storage Account tier if not explicit
- upload blob to tier of choiuce
- `rehydrating blob` - means move data out of archive - takes hours
- `lifecycle management` - rules to move data automatically between tiers

### Acces Tier Blobs
- Cool storage - less paid for storage - 2x for access, min 30 days the file will be there
- Hot storage - more for storage less for access
- Archive - the most less for storage price but no immediate access to files  - paying min for 180 days

### Azure Files
- Fully managed file share in cloud
- Allow Samba and NFS too and VMs can be mixed
- Used to replace local NAS
- Lift and shift your premise storage to the cloud == means no data architecture change is required, import VMs to Azure
- Classic - App and data is moved to cloud
- Hybrid - data is moved to cloud, App stays on premise
- Used to share data quickly between VMs, diagnostics or dev/test/debug for developers
- Can be used for containers as persistent storage
- Extremly resilient and durable

- Backups are snapshot based, read only and incremental, max 200 snapshots per share and can be kept for 10year
- Soft Deleet - like a lock, allow to prevent accidental deletion
- Advanced Threat Protection - anomaly based detection for security
- Accessible from inside or outside of AWS Account from anywhere via `public endpoint`
- `Encryption` - data at rest is encrypted by SSE
- Data in transit are encrypted by TLS

### Acces Tier for Files
- 3 types:
 = Premium - SSD, single digit milisecond, high IOPS
 = Transaction optmizied - same as standard, HDD, transaction heavy workload and don't need super latency
 = Hot - General purpose like team shares or Azure File Sync
 = Cool - Stored on HDD for cost effiction storage, online archive

### Azure File Sync
- Cache files from Onpremise or cloud to allow communication between them
- Supports NFS, SMB, FTPs
- Multiple caches are supported accross the world

### Azure Storage Explorer
- Application for Windows, linux and mac
- Used to make easier to work with blob, create folders, see data and so

### AZCopy
- CLI utility (dedicated package for various systems)
- use to copy blobs or files to or from storage account
- Using Azure AD or Shared Access Signature (SAS) to gain access, login via azcopy login (popup window to authenticate)
- Example: azcopy copy '/root/text.txt' '<endpoint url for blob>'

### Aure Import/Export Service
- Used to move large amount of data to Azure
- You can use own disk or microsoft provides disks (5 SSD disks with a 40TB)
- Using bitlocker to encrypt files
- Gnerate journal drivers
- Using WAImportExport tool to copy v1 = into blob storage, v2 = into file storage

### Azure Shared Access Signature SAS
- is URI that grants restristred right to access resource on storage account
- temporary access
- Same is premium URLs in AWS
- Types:
 = Account Level SAS - access resource in one or more storage services
 = Service Level SAS - single storage account by storage account key
 = Used Delegate SAS - using Azure AD credentials to acces, limited to blobs and containers, best method

## Azure Virtual Machines
- the size of VM is determined by the image
- Current limitation: may change - 20 VMs per region
- Azure Marketplace - place to find any kind of OS and images
- There are many images which are optimized for Azure
- VMs are gouped mostly to:
 = Types = General Purpose and Compute Optimized, ... = Balanced CPU to memory ratio, testing
 = Sizes = B,Dsv3, ... (Called SKU)

- Virtualization is based on Hyper-V
- 2 generations are possible:
 - Gen1 = support most gues OS
 - Gen2 = support most 64bit version of Windows, linux, freebsd

 Gen-1 = BIOS based
 Gen-2 = UEFI based boot (secure boot, larger boot volumes)

 - Hyper-V VM are using VHD or VHDX format for disks

- Login to nodes via SSH,RDP or Bastion server

### Azure Bastion Server
- Jumphost server
- Create for specific subnet
- Its able to connect to VMs via Browser and the Azure Portal
- Provides seamless RDP and SSH access

### Azure Mobile App
- Able to monitor the state of VMs, see alerts and so
- Possible to monitor more like WebApps, SQL DB, ...

### Custom Scripts
- 2 options:
  - Extension - for Windows - we can add via Extension -> Custom Script Extension, after run Power Shell or other configs
  - CloudInit - for Linux machines

### Update Management
- Manage OS updates automatically from Azure Portal
- Can be used for Azure VMs, on Prem or other cloud VMs
- Require a client to be installd MMA (Microsoft Monitoring Agent)
- Every Windows machine is monitored and scanned every 12h
- Every Linux machine is scanned every 3h
- It takes 30min - 6h to show updated data in dashboard 
- Azure Automation service can leverage it

### Azure Disks
- Block level storage volumes for VMs
- 5x9's durability
- Creates 3 copies of data
- max 50000 disks per region
- max 1000 VMs in VMSS
- 2 types of encryption:
 = 1. SSE - server side encryption - enabled by default, temporary disks are not encrypted unless enabled in OS
   = Can be platfrom managed keys - Azure manage the keys or Customer managed keys  
 = 2. Azure Disk Encryption - Allow to encrypt OS and Data disks used bya IaaaS - done by bitlocker in windows or DM-Crypt in linux

- Disk roles:
 = 1. OS Disk - operating disks is located here, conatains boot volume (C:/ drive)
 = 2. Temporary disk - temporary data which is not managed - data is not persistent in MW but reboot persist, swap disk can be this too (D:/ drive)
 = 3. Data disk - additonal disks to store main data - iSCSI disks, multiple supported

 ### Azure disk snapshots
 - Managed Disk Snapshot = Read Only crash consistent full copy of a managed disk - stored as standard managed disk
  = Point in time recovery
  = independent from main disk
  = Billed based on size

- Managed Custom Image 
 = Image copy 
 = Keeps all managed disks (VM + data disks)

### Azure Disk types
- Ultra Disks = havies workloads, up to 160000 IOS and 2000 MB throughput, used for SAP HANA and top tier DBs, used only as data disk 
- Premium SSD = High performance IO intensive workaloads, misssion critical workloads, Guanteed IOPS, 20000 IOPS
- Standard SSD = consistent, lower iops, suitable for webservers
- Standard HDD = low cost, good avaiability but latency can be higher

### Azure Bursting
- boost the IOPS and MB/s performance for a period of time on both VMs and disks
- allow to handle spike traffics
- Burstable VMs are: Lsv2, Ds3, Esv3
- Specific disks allow bursting like: Premium SSD - P20 adnd smaller

### Application Gateway
- operates at application level and doing load balancing
- L7 at OSI layer
- Routing based on path
- Supports to attach WAF
- 3 things to setup:
 = Frontend - private or public IP (or both) 
 = Routing rules -  rules and listenners based on what to forward 
 = Backend pools - collection of resources where to send traffic (VMs, VMSS, IP addresses, ...)

### Routing rules
- Listenners - on port and IP address
- 2 types of listenners:
 = 1. Basic - forward all requests to any domain to backend pools
 = 2. Multisite - forward to multiple and different pools on host header and hostn name

- Backend targets - where the route should go also specifies bakcend port and protocol (HTTP,HTTPS)
- 2 types: 
 = 1. Backend Pools 
 = 2. Redirect
- More option possible for HTTP header (cokies and so)

- Supports connection draining to wait some time before not sending more 
- Cookie affinity - sticky sessions
- Request timeouts - if no feedback it will mark dead, inn secons
- Supports to override bakend

### Azure Scale Sets
- Like ASG in AWS
- Automatically increase or decrease VM capicity (scale out or scale in)
- Create scalling policies
- Replace unhealhu instances

- Load balancer and scale sets are good integration for production traffic
- Load balancer can send probe sets to check health of VMs
- Azure application GW or Load balancers both supports VMSS

- Scaling policy - define when to do scale in or out
 = Supports to use CPU% threshlod, number of VMs to add and so
 = Rules can use more robust metric - Network In/Out, Disk Reads, CPU credits, CPU %
 = Out of simple metrics, can be collected more but we need for more use App Insight (application side  metrics, Page load, ...) or Azure Diagnostics Extension (VM detailed host metrics)

- Scale-In Policy - define which VM to delete after scale in:
 = Default - Highest Instance ID (Balance accross AZ and Faulty Domains)
 = Newest VM
 = Oldest VM

- Update Policy - when VMs are having update, how to perform:
 = Automatic - Immediately with random order
 = Manual
 = Rolling - group of VMs are updated at the same time

- Health monitoring - Decide if VMs are healhy or not
- 2 modes:
 = 1. Application Health Extension - HTTP/HTTS request check for status 200 (protocl, port and path
 = 2. Load Balancer Probe - Allow to check TCP,UDP or HTTP
- Automatic repair policy - if instance is unhealhty if to keep or replace

### Azure App Services
- Deploy and Manage Web Application withou worry about infra
- PaaS
- Used for hosting Web Apps, Res APIs and mobile backends
- Choose any programming language
- It creates automatically the service behind and manage them
- Easy integration of DevOps, DockerHub integeration, Github, package manager
- Pay plans:
 - Free Tiers - 1GB space, max 10 Apps on 1 instance, NO SLA guaranteed, 60min/day
 - Shared Tier - free, shared (no linux support), 100 Apps, NO Sla, Compute quota 240min/day
 - Dedicated Tier - Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, V3 = Unlimited Apps, some SLAs, load balancing and VMSS, SLA of 99.95% 
 - Isolated Tier - dedicated vNET, full network and Compute isolation, SLA 99.95% (ASE)

- During creation use a custom name - this will be the domain name
- Runtime environments - which programming language and libraries are using
- Choos runtime and corresponding version:
 = .Net/.Net core
 = Java 
 = Ruby
 = Node.js
 = Python
 = PHP

- Custom Containers are supported like docker -> push to registry and deploy an App service
- Custom containers are good for 3rd party or unsupported langauges
- Deployments slots are good for staging and QA env = different environment
- Supports swap environments where create new production quickly after testing is posible

- App Service Environments (ASE)- higher level, more functions and supports bigger deployment demands 
- Azure App Deployment - Options to push changes and updates from local env to remote env:
 = Using Package, ZIP/WR, Deploy via FTP, Cloudbox, Dropbox, OneDrive (all 3x before are using sync the folders automatically), ...

- WebJobs - free, allow to run a custom program and script in same instance for web app or API service or mobile APP - no linux support
 = Continous Run - like a service or deamon mode
 = Triggered - runs when requested - manual or scheduled (cron job)

- Supports 2 modes where to run:
 = single instance
 = multi instance

 ## Azure Monitor
 - Collect, analyze and act for telemetry data
 - Dashboards, alerts, reports, ...
 - Various sources of Data:
  = Applications
  = Operating System
  = Azure Resources
  = Azure Subsciptions
  = Azure Tenant
  = Custom Sources

- We save data to Data Stores:
 = Logs - consolidated form of logs for perforamnce via
 = Metrics - time series DB
- We can use custom functions to do the stuff with Data Stores
- We can use Insight, Visualization tools, Smart Analysis tools, Automatic Actions (alerts, autoscale), Intgrations (to other or custom services)

### Azure Data Sources
- `Application Code`
 = Inspect data from code itself
 = Performance traces, logs, telemetry
 = Install instrumentation package to code -> for data collections
 = Install Availibality ests -> to see repsonsivness of the app
 = Saving to 3x Data stores - Metrics, Logs and Storage

- `OS Monitor`
 = Use Diagnostics Extension to collect metrics
 = Log Analytics Agent - to collect logs
 = Dependency Agent - data about process running on VM and collect external dependencies
 = This can use Event Hub to forwar the events

- `Azure Resources`
 = Resource logs -> insight into the operation for Azure resource and created automatically
 = Metrics are used to see the performance
 = Azure storage is used for archiving

- `Azure Subscription`
 = Monitors Azure Service Health if they are running#
 = Monitors Azure AD

- `Azure Tenant`
 = Monitors telemetry tenant wide services, like Azure AD

- `Custom Sources`
 = Using Azure Monitor API via to push the Metrics and Logs to Stores

### Log Analytics Workspace
- Unique environment for Azure to Monitor logs data
- Each workspace has own data repository, config, sources and solutions
- Data explorer is using Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Similar language to SQL to query the logs data, it can be used in various services
- commands start with. E.g. .create table, .show tables

### Metrics Explorer
- Sub service of Azure Monitor
- Helps to visualize data, crate charts to analyze spikes and trends
- Using metrics DB

### Azure Alerts
- Notification services
- 3 services:
 = Metrics Alerts
 = Log Alerts
 = Activity Alerts

### Azure Workbooks
- flexible canvas for data analysis - rich visual reports
- Story - about performance and avialability of application and services

### Application Insight
- Application Performance and Managemtn service 
- Used for application performance and availability of software apps
- helps to diagnose complex issues
- using automatic anomaly detection
- powerful analytics tool
- used to continuously improve performance and usability

## Azure Backup Services
- No dedicated service to backup all
- Its per service feature
- Supports: VM, Files, On Prem, SQL Server, SAP HANNA, DBs

- Azure backup policy can help to schedule and define how often do backup and keep it
- 

### Azure Recovery Service Vault
- Vaults - is a storage entity that house data and recovery points 
- Data is copied there, configs, info about workloads, VMs, servers
- Backup data for various servers: IaaS VMs or Azure SQL DBs
- Sexure and enhanced capabilities
- Azure RBAC
- Soft delete
- Cross replication

### MARS Agent
- Azure recovery service agent
- Installed on Windows VMs or on prem Windows machines
- Helps to backup files,folders and system state
- Saving the files and things to Vault (before chapter)

### Azure site recovery
- hybrid - on prem to cloud, backup solution
- used for site-to-site recovery
- ensure Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
- replicates a workload from primary site to secondary
- in case of issius it can failover
- Supports replication of VMs, any OS, on prem, wmvare, hyper-v, physical machines, between cloud providers

## Azure Container Instances
- Allow to launch conatiners directly in Azure
- Supports various sources as: Azure Container Registry, Docker Hub, Private Container Registry
- Container groups are collections of containers running on same machine 
- Groups are sharing: lifecycle, resources, local network, storage volumes
- Multi container groups supports only linux containers
- Deploy multi containers:
 = Resources Manager Templates (ARM) - when used with additional resources
 = YAML - only for container definitions

- Container restart policies - define how the container restarts:
 = Always - always running - good for web servers
 = Never - run one time only
 = OnFailure

- Container Env Variables - allow to pass key/values to containers
- Supports secret variables

- Container Persistent Storage - keeps data even after container restart
- Mounting Azure Files, Secret Volume, Empty Dir or Cloud git repo can help to save persistent data
- Mounting require CLI or Powershell

- CLI helpers for container:
 = az container logs --resources-group <name> --name <name>
 = az container attach --resource-group <name> --name <name> # to get startup diagnostic
 = az container exec --resource-group <name> --name <name> --exec-command /bin/sh #get to interactive mode
 = az monitor metrics list --resource <container id> --metric <metric name> --output <format , e.g.table> #Get metrics 

### Azure Container Registry
- Used to storage and manage custom container images
- private Docker registry service (based on 2.0)
- Supports to build pipelines or tasks to build container images
- We can pull to various targets:
 = Kubernetes
 = DC/OS
 = Docker Swarm
 = AKS
 = App Service
 = Batch
 = Azure Service Fabric

- Can be used via CLI, Portal, Powershell SDK
- ACR Tasks - help to automate the OS and framework patching for Docker containers
 = Quick tasks - without need for local docker engine - used to push image to registry
 = Triggered Automated Builds allow Source Code updates, base image update, timers on schedule
 = Multi-Step tasks are supported too - can use variables

## Azure Kubernetes Service
- Fully managed Kubernetes
- Azure manage Kubernetes Master, monitoring and maintanance
- Customer only maintain and pay for agent nodes
- Supports Azure AD integration to Kuberenetes
- Windows server containers are supported
- Advanced networking

### Bridge to Kubernetes
- Extension to Visual studio
- Inlcude a local running service to AKS cluster
- Side step to create docker and kubernetes config
- Using proxy to connect directly to K8s cluster

## Azure DNS
- Azure just manage DNS, we cannot purchase domains
- Alias - point directly to Azure resource instead of DNS name
- Record set - group of records, suggested to use always
