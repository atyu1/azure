### Terminology
`Domain` - area of network orginzs by single auth db
`Domain Controller` - server that do authentication and authorization
`Domain Computer` - registered device to the auth db ==> AD Object
`AD Object` - an elemnt of AD like: User or Group or Printer or Computer 
`Group Policy Object` - virtual collection of policies for AD objects
`Organization Unit` - subidivion/subfolder of and AD - place inside objectets or other OU
`Directory Service` - provides method of storing directory data and making it availale

### Managing multi-tenant user
- tenant is represented by unique `domain` - like test.com 
- if domain is not specified we use: test.microsoft.com
- every account is part of at least 1 tenant
- tenant must have subscription associated in order to be able create resources
- tenant can have 2+ subscriptions too

- `Subscriptions` - independent to tenant or user 
- Paymenet agreement
- 3 types:
 1. Free
 2. Pay as you go
 3. Enterprise

### Azure AD connect/join
- Connect on prem to AD in Cloud (Azure AD)
- We can use cloud-only to authenticate to Windows Machines on Prem
- When you don't have on prem AD
- When you dont want to put some users to on prem AD
- Add support for SSO
- Features:
  - Password hash sync - sync hash for passwords with on prem
  - Pass-through - allow to use same user/pass on prem and on cloud too
  - Federation - hybrid environment using on prem AD FS infra
  - Synchronization - auto sync between om prem and cloud for users/groups/...
  - Health Monitoring - provides central monitoring in azure portal

### Administrative Units
- Used in large org. and divide them to multiple groups (administrative units)
- Easier management
- Assing roles to Administrative units
- Premium feature

### Manage Users and Groups
- username can be email only from associated domain
- its possible to invite too by emails
- Dynamic Groups - add users automatically to groups based on conditions
- Guest Users = users which are part of another organization - possible to invite

- Password reset can be enabled per group - after users can do it themself 
- Password reset can use email, phone num, Microsoft App Code, Office Phone, security questions 
  - Auth info is valid for 180 days by default
- Password reset can be enabled for selected users or all or none (no group option)
- Assign roles or applications directly to group
- Groups can have:
 - Owners - have permissions + manage members
 - Member - have permissions

- Assign access rights to users
  - direct assignements - assign manually to users
  - group assignements - assign permissions via group to users
  - rule based - create rule which dynamically assign users to groups
  - external authority - access come via external source like on prem or Saas

- Deleted remains for 30 days as deleted - can be reverted for accidental delete

### Bulk Operations:
- We can create, invite, delete & download users
- It can be through one bulk csv file which is uploaded

### Device Management
- Manage physical devices - like phones, pc, printers
- See what is connected
- Device can be added - external registration
- After permission can be specified
- We can limit only users from registered devices
- In Windows - there is App: Connect -> this can register to Azure -> enter user/pass and it will be done
- We can utilize BYOD and see if device are secure enough
- 3 ways:
 1. Azure AD registered 
  = personal devices 
  = signed with Microsoft account or local account 
  = targeting personal accounts 
  = no org linked, BYOD or mobile dev
  = Android, Mac, IIOS, Win 10
  = Sign in: end user, password, win hello, PIN, biometrics or pattern on phone
  = Device Management by intune or App Management
  = SSO
 2. Azure AD joined 
  = owned by org and signed with Azure AD belonging to org
  = exists only in cloud
  = suitable for cloud only and hybrid (private cloud) org
  = Device sign in: Password, Win Hello for Business, FIDO2.0
  = Device management by intune or Microsoft Endpoint Configuration ManagerÃŸ
  = Supports SSO to both cloud and on prem Dev
  = Conditional Access through MDM enrollment and compliance evaluation 
  = Entrerpise state roaming
  = Azure AD Domain services belonging to that org, they exists in cloud or on prem
 3, Hybrid Azure AD joined devices
  = Suitable for org, with local AD and wanna mix them with Azure
  = Devices owned by organization
  = Password loging or Windows Hello for business
  = Use windows autopilot = automated device provisioning for new windows devices
  = Windows autopilot = if provisioned, devices can be maanged by: Intune, Windows Update for Business, Microsoft endpoint config manager

### Windows Hello
- Windows 10 service to login via alternate way like, fingerprint, iris scan or facial recognition

### Azure MDM and MAM
- Mobile Device Management (MDM) - control the entire device, wipe data and so
- Mobile Application Management (MAM) - publish, push and configure, secure, monitor and update mobile apps 
- Both are part of: Microsoft Intune => part of Premium 2
- Intune is part of Microsoft Endpoint Manager == part of ===> Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS)
- EMS - is inteligent mobility management and security platform. Protect and Seure your org and empowers flexibility
- EMS - multiple services are part of it like: Azure AD or Intune and more

### Regions
- Classic, closer to customer, data is located in same place, some services are avialable only on some, some of them are global services 
- Regional pairs are siblings for specific regions to create better HA

### Microsoft Authenticator App
- like Duo - used for 2 factor auth + passwordless or password autofill

### Roles
- 3 types of roles exists (origin): (next sections)
 = Classic Admin - original role (used rarely)
 = Azure roles - RBAC on top of resource management
 = Azure AD roles - used to manage Azure AD resources in a directory

### Classic Administrators
- 3 types of roles:
 = Account Admin - billing owner, no access to azure portal
 = Service Admin - same access of user asssigned the owner role at subscriptions scope. Full portal access
 = Co-Admin - same access as user who assigned the owner

### RBAC
- Used for Authorization
 - 2 types: builtin and custom
- Highest Role: Global Administrator
- We can greant access to recources or resource groups
- Roles can be assigned to users, user groups, service principle
- Role assignements consists of:
 = security principal - user, group or security principal (identity of applications or services)
 = role definition - collection of permissios - specify if operation can read, write or delete
 = scope - set of resources (mgmt group, subscription, resource groups or resources) - which it applies to
- Deny Assignement - deny some specific actions even if roles allow it
- Custom roles can be created we need Premium Level plan
- Custom can specify like: Read and Update (don't delete) - add permsissions/actions
- We can include or exclude permissions (all except selected)

### Azure AD Roles
- used to manage Azure AD resources in dir like
  = create or edit users
  = reset user passwords
  = manage domains
  = manage licences

- Built in roles:
 = Global Admin - Full access to everything
 = User admin - full access to create and manage users
 = Billing admin - make purchase, manage subscriptions and support tickets

- Custom roles can be created by having Azure AD Premium P1 or P2

### Azure Policies vs Azure Roles (RBAC)
- Policies - ensure compliance of resources - evaluates - does not restrict just review and alarm
- Roles - control access and limit what we can do - restrict access and permissions

### Azure AD Resource vs Azure Roles (RBAC)
- AD Roles - control access to AD resouces (like users, groups, billing, licensing...)
- RBAC - control access to Azure resources (virtual machines, databases, storage, networking, ...)
- By default global admin does not have acces to Azure resources

### Azure Resource Manager
- Not a single services but multiple services
- Allow to create, update and delete resources
- Its a middleware between requester (CLI, API, SDK) and actual resources <--> Communicates with Authentication service
- Scope is a logical grouping of resources
- Sopes: Management Groups -> Subscriptions -> Resource Groups and Actual Resources

### Management Groups
- Contains another layer of managerment groups or subsciptions
- Used to group subscriptions
- Apply policies there

### Subscriptions
- Identity = name used for auth
- Account = user or app - used for authentication, Identity + More info
- Tenant = orgnaization - represented by domain name
- Subscription is billing agreement (Free, pay as you go, azure for students)
- Resource is any entity managed by account - VM, WebApp, Storage Account, anything created
- Resource groups - Organize resources to group 
- All resources can belong to 1 resource group only

- We can add users to subscription, shared payment
- Susbscription can have access control - various roles can be chosed - cores are Owner/Contributor/Reader
- Contributor cannot assign other users to subscriptions (owner can)

- `Cost Management and Billing`
- It can do cost analysis and predict what we will pay
- See invoices and billings

- `Resource [Group] Locks`
- We can lock so users who don't have permission cannot create resources
- Users with permissions can delete locks
- Lock types:
 - Read-Only - don't delete/create/update any resource
 - Delete - just don't delete resource

- `Azure Policy`
- Limit users to not create expensive resources
- Define policies to enforce company standards and SLAs
- It can also limit Resource Types, versions, locations, default tagging, VM SKUs (Flavor)
- In GUI, its 'Policy"
- Scope - for full subscription or Resource Groups under Subscription
- Policies can be applied on Resource Groups level to for example ensure policicies like have tag or encrypted disk
- Policy can be associated with powershell too, example:
1. Save Policy Def
 ```$policy = Get-AzPolicyDefinition | Where-Object { $_.Properties.DisplayName -eq "Policy name" }```

2. Create RG
 ``` New-AzResourceGroup -Name "test-rg" -Location "East EU" ```

3. Save it to variable
```$rg = Get-AzResourceGroup -Name "test-rg" -Location "East EU" ```

4. Assign Policy
``` New-AzPolicyAssignement -Name "Rulez" -DisplayName "Rulez" -Scope $rg.ResourceId -PolicyDefinition $policy ```

### Resources Providers
- Allow to use specific resources
- Register to them (enable them) like Kubernetes and after you can use it
- Enable under subscriptions

### Relationship between User Subscritpion Tenant
- User - lowest level
- Tenant - exist by defualt (contains users)
- To create resource we need subscription
- We can have multiple subscriptions 
- Subscriptions are associated with users
- Management group contains subscriptions or other MGMT groups
- We can add users to Management Groups and then they will have proper subscriptions


## Manage Azure Storage Accounts
- Like S3 in AWS
- Containers are like dirs/folders where we can upload files

### Providing access
- Access keys - 2x can be generated - can be changed if needed, permanent access, mostly for scripts
- Shred Access Signature (SAS) - additional access key with limited timeline, can be defined how long its valid

### Acces Tier
- Cool storage - less paid for storage - 2x for access, min 30 days the file will be there
- Hot storage - more for storage less for access
- Archive - the most less for storage price but no immediate access to files  - paying min for 180 days

### Lifcycle management
- Automated movement between tiers for files

### Object Replication
- Blob Service -> Object Replication
- Async copy to another account automatically

## Azure Virtual Machines

### Custom Scripts
- 2 options:
  - Extension - for Windows - we can add via Extension -> Custom Script Extension, after run Power Shell or other configs
  - CloudInit - for Linux machines

### Azure Bastion Server
- Jumphost server
- Create for specific subnet
